**BlueScript** is a small and efficient programming language designed specifically for microcontrollers.  
While it currently supports only the ESP32 board, future updates will include support for a wider range of boards.
You can find the official website at https://csg-tokyo.github.io/bluescript/.

WARNING: this project is in beta stage and is subject to changes of the code-base, including project-wide name changes and API changes.
